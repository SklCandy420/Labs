Write a python program to load a sample text corpus file and perform the following operation:
1) Tokenize the corpus into words and print the words and word count.
2) Calculate the size of vocabulary.
3) Tokenize the corpus into sentences and print the sentences and sentence count. Short forms that include "." should be taken care.
4) Prepare a new document by removing the duplicate sentences or multiple instances of a sentence. Assign each sentence a unique id. Display the document.
